    # FAQ accordion

    ## Brief

    Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    Your users should be able to:
    - Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
    - Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
    - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    
    Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

    - [Do the challenge yourself](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz).

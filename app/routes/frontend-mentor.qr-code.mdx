    # QR Code Component

    ## Brief

    Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    Download the starter code and go through the `README.md` file. This will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.md` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

    [Do the challenge yourself](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).
